## ❓ How To 
* Ufetch - Tiny system info for Unix-like operating systems
```
I have saved my ufetch config in /home/encrypt3db0t/Documents/Configs/Ufetch
To output the fetch results 

$~ vim .bashrc
/home/encrypt3db0t/Documents/Configs/Ufetch/mint
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
This would display :
