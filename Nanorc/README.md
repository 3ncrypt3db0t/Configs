# Syntax Highlighting
Nano ships with syntax highlighting rules for most popular file types. On most Linux systems, the syntax files are stored in the /usr/share/nano directory and included by default in the /etc/nanorc configuration file.
/etc/nanorc
include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"

OR 
"/.nano/*.nanorc"

Copy or wget the files as per your requirements
```
